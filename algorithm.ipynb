    "## Algorithmic Question (AQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Arya needs to travel between cities using a network of flights. Each flight has a fixed cost (in euros), and she wants to find the cheapest possible way to travel from her starting city to her destination city. However, there are some constraints on the journey:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arya can make at most `k` stops during her trip (this means up to `k+1` flights).\n",
    "2. If no valid route exists within these constraints, the result should be `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph of cities connected by flights, your job is to find the minimum cost for Arya to travel between two specified cities (`src` to `dst`) while following the constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "- **a)** Write a pseudocode that describes the algorithm to find the cheapest route with at most `k` stops. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **b)** Implement the algorithm in Python and simulate the given test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **c)** Analyze the algorithm's efficiency. Provide its time complexity and space complexity, and explain whether it is efficient for large graphs (e.g., `n > 100`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **d)** Optimize the algorithm to handle larger graphs. Provide an updated pseudocode and analyze the computational complexity of your optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **e)** Ask LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) for an optimized version of your algorithm. Compare its solution to yours in terms of performance, time complexity, and correctness.\n",

    "### Why This is Better for Large Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simpler Operations**: The Bellman-Ford approach avoids the overhead of maintaining a priority queue.\n",
    "2. **Linear Growth with \\(k\\)**: The time complexity scales linearly with \\(k+1\\), making it efficient for large graphs with small constraints on stops.\n",
    "3. **Constant Space Overhead**: It uses \\(O(n)\\) space, making it memory-efficient compared to the priority queue implementation.\n",

    "**Key Observation**:  \n",
    "The Bellman-Ford optimization is more straightforward, especially when the number of stops (\\(k\\)) is small relative to the graph size. For large graphs with millions of edges, this approach significantly reduces the computational overhead. "
