    "## Algorithmic Question (AQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Arya needs to travel between cities using a network of flights. Each flight has a fixed cost (in euros), and she wants to find the cheapest possible way to travel from her starting city to her destination city. However, there are some constraints on the journey:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Arya can make at most `k` stops during her trip (this means up to `k+1` flights).\n",
    "2. If no valid route exists within these constraints, the result should be `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph of cities connected by flights, your job is to find the minimum cost for Arya to travel between two specified cities (`src` to `dst`) while following the constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "- **a)** Write a pseudocode that describes the algorithm to find the cheapest route with at most `k` stops. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- **b)** Implement the algorithm in Python and simulate the given test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **c)** Analyze the algorithm's efficiency. Provide its time complexity and space complexity, and explain whether it is efficient for large graphs (e.g., `n > 100`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **d)** Optimize the algorithm to handle larger graphs. Provide an updated pseudocode and analyze the computational complexity of your optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **e)** Ask LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) for an optimized version of your algorithm. Compare its solution to yours in terms of performance, time complexity, and correctness.\n",

    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "n = 4  \n",
    "flights = [[0, 1, 100], [1, 2, 100], [2, 0, 100], [1, 3, 600], [2, 3, 200]]  \n",
    "src = 0  \n",
    "dst = 3  \n",
    "k = 1  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "700  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Arya's optimal path with at most 1 stop is `0 → 1 → 3`, costing 100 + 600 = 700 euros.  \n",
    "The path `0 → 1 → 2 → 3` is cheaper but requires 2 stops, which violates the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "n = 3  \n",
    "flights = [[0, 1, 100], [1, 2, 100], [0, 2, 500]]  \n",
    "src = 0  \n",
    "dst = 2  \n",
    "k = 1  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "200  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Arya's optimal path with at most 1 stop is `0 → 1 → 2`, costing 100 + 100 = 200 euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "n = 3  \n",
    "flights = [[0, 1, 100], [1, 2, 100], [0, 2, 500]]  \n",
    "src = 0  \n",
    "dst = 2  \n",
    "k = 0  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "500  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Arya cannot make any stops. The only valid route is `0 → 2`, costing 500 euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "n = 4  \n",
    "flights = [[0, 1, 100], [0, 2, 200], [1, 3, 300], [2, 3, 300]]  \n",
    "src = 0  \n",
    "dst = 3  \n",
    "k = 2  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "400  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Arya can take `0 → 1 → 3` and `0 → 2 → 3`, however first one is cheaper, costing 400 euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "n = 4  \n",
    "flights = [[0, 1, 100], [0, 2, 200], [1, 3, 300], [2, 3, 200]]  \n",
    "src = 0  \n",
    "dst = 3  \n",
    "k = 2  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "```py\n",
    "400  \n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Arya can take `0 → 1 → 3` and `0 → 2 → 3` like last example. However we have a tie, so it does not matter the route we take, the cost is still 400."
